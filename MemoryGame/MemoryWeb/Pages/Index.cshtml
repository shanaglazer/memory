        <h4>Overview</h4>
        This document describes requirements for the software implementation of the classic game of memory.
        This software will allow two players to play against each other. A description of the game plus the
        requirements of this implementation are provided below.
        
        <h4>The game</h4>
        Two players are presented with 30 playing cards. The players take turns opening a pair of cards. Player
        who picks two cards of the same letter – one uppercase and one lowercase gets a point. The winner is
        the player with the most points when the cards are finished. No way of ending the game with a tie.
        <h2>Software implementation</h2>
        <h4>UI elements</h4>
        The software will present the memory game with the UI elements listed below.
        5x6 Grid of buttons
        Start game button
        Two score labels - one for player
        Label to display messages – players turn, matching pair, and winner.
        
        <h4>Player modes</h4>
        There is just one mode in this game – two players. Each player has a turn to click on two cards and if he
        gets a pair the score goes up by a point.
